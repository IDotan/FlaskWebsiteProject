# FlaskWebsiteProject
work in progress

### completed:
* site skeleton, and basic functionality.
* tests and full coverage.
* database maneging and only logged user allowed to change the database.
* ToDo list work both with logged and not logged user.

### working on:
* CSS to all the pages so far, learning from scratch may take some time.

### Next up:
* GUI for the site start with build in option changes.
* email code to reset password (forgot password).

##### More ideas:
* add weather widget (local and multi locations), both logged and not logged same as the ToDo list.
* search bar to multi search engines.
* pass-time mini games. (probably best to be JavaScript so unlikely to happen, mainly want to focus on python).
